# 2. Analog Clock Using Pure JavaScript

This project is a simple analog clock built using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. The clock displays the current time with hour, minute, and second hands, updating every second in real time.

## Features

- Pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (no libraries or frameworks)
- Customizable clock face (replace `Clock.png` with your own image if desired)
- Smooth rotation of hour, minute, and second hands
- Responsive and centered design

## How It Works

- The clock face is set as a background image.
- Three divs represent the hour, minute, and second hands.
- JavaScript calculates the rotation for each hand based on the current time and updates their positions every second.

## Usage

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Make sure `index.html`, `index.css`, `index.js`, and `Clock.png` are in the same folder.
3. Open `index.html` in your browser to view the clock.
